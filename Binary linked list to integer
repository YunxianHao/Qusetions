//Give you a single linked list reference node head. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. It is known that this linked list is a binary representation of an integer number.
//Please return the decimal value of the number represented by the linked list
Code:
int getDecimalValue(struct ListNode* head){
    int ans[31];int sum = 0;
    while(head)
    {
        sum = sum*2 + head->val;
        head = head->next;
    }
    return sum;
}
